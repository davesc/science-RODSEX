# science_RODSEX/ELF
Extreme Low Frequency (ELF, because it's lower than VLF, and Extreme>Very) velocity
spectra for RODSEX data using Lomb-Scargle periodograms to get spectra with an 8 minute
gap every hour.


RODSEX_ELF_0927_all.m, RODSEX_ELF_1009_all.m
    ELF spectra for all standalone instrument locations, and 1 ring ADV
    
RODSEX_ELF_0927_xshore.m, RODSEX_ELF_1009_xshore.m
    ELF spectra for all standalone instrument locations, grouped by cross-shore lines
    
RODSEX_ELF_1001.m, RODSEX_ELF_1008.m, RODSEX_ELF_1014.m
    ELF spectra alongshore-3s line only

RODSEX_ELF_power_all.m
    ELF spectral sum (total ELF variance) for all standalone instrument locations, and 
    1 ring ADV, for all days, saved in RODSEX_ELF_power_all.mat
